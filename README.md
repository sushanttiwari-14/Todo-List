# Todo List App 📱

This is a simple Todo List app I built while learning iOS development using SwiftUI.  
The goal of this project was to understand how SwiftUI works and how different parts of an app connect together.

## What this app does
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete and reorder tasks
- Save data locally so tasks don’t disappear after closing the app
- Shows a clean empty state when there are no tasks
- Works on iPhone and iPad (portrait & landscape)

## Tech used
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- MVVM pattern
- UserDefaults for data persistence
- Xcode
- Git & GitHub

## What I learned from this project
- How SwiftUI views work
- Using `@State`, `@StateObject`, and `@EnvironmentObject`
- How MVVM is structured in a real app
- Saving and loading data using UserDefaults
- Creating a launch screen and app icon
- Basic Git workflow (commit, push, README)

## Why I built this
I’m learning iOS development and wanted to build something practical instead of just following tutorials.  
This project helped me understand how things actually work together in a real app.

## Screenshots
Will add screenshots later.
